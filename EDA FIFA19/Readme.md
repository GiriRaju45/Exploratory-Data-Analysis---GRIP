# Exploratory Data Analysis on FIFA-19 Dataset

## Introduction

This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the FIFA-19 dataset, which contains comprehensive information about football players and teams from the popular FIFA video game series. EDA is a crucial step in data analysis that helps us gain insights, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. In this project, we will explore various aspects of the FIFA-19 dataset to understand player attributes, team statistics, and other relevant information.

## Dataset Description

The FIFA-19 dataset used in this project contains the following key attributes:

- **Player attributes**: Information about individual players, including their name, age, nationality, position, overall rating, potential rating, and various skill ratings such as dribbling, shooting, and passing.

- **Team statistics**: Data on football clubs and their attributes, including team name, league, budget, and overall team rating.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: We will perform a thorough exploration of the FIFA-19 dataset, including summary statistics, data visualization, and distribution analysis to gain a deep understanding of the data.

2. **Player Analysis**: We will analyze player attributes, such as age, nationality, and position, to identify trends and patterns. Additionally, we will visualize the distribution of player ratings.

3. **Team Analysis**: We will explore team statistics, such as budget, league, and overall team rating, to uncover insights about successful teams in the dataset.

4. **Data Visualization**: We will create various plots and graphs to visualize the relationships and patterns present in the data, making it easier to interpret and communicate findings.

5. **Insights and Conclusions**: Based on the analysis, we will draw meaningful insights and conclusions about the FIFA-19 dataset, such as the distribution of player skills, the relationship between age and player rating, and more.

## Tools and Libraries

To conduct this analysis, we will use the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: We will use Python as the primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: We will work within a Jupyter Notebook environment to execute code, document the analysis, and visualize the results.

- **Pandas**: Pandas will be used for data manipulation and cleaning.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries will help us create various data visualizations.
